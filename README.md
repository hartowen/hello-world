## Welcome to my GitHub page

On this site I am going to be uploading projects that I work on.  I'm a very beginner at computer science and data science so these will not be groundbreaking projects, but I wanted to dip my toes in.

### Project Ideas

1. I am wanted to use data from MIT Election Lab and Opensecrets.org to come up with a quantifiable (dollar) value associated with a vote from individual precincts based on 2016 spending data.  I will use this to estimate where the most money will flow into this election cylce.

2. After reading, _Weapons of Math Destruction_, by Cathy O'Neil, I was saddened but not surprised to see the damage done to mostly poor people by corporations and governement agency's wielding flawed mathematical tools.  While reading, I thought it would be an interesting project to understand the damage done by these WMD, through financial set backs.  This is a harder project to undertake because there is no unified source to go to.
